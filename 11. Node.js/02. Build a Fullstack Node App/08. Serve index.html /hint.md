Challenge 1:
 Use the readFile() method and pass in the path to index.html.
 Do not specify encoding - we want a buffer.


Challenge 2:
 Remember to set the status code and the Content-Type, and to include a payload.


Challenge 3:
 You can write code inside the try block.
 In server.js, remember to pass 'res' to serveStatic.
