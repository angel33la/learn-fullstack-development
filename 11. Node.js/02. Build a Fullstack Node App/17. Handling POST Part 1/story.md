The Ghost in Accounting

At our office, the third cubicle from the break room was always mysteriously empty. People said it was “reserved for remote workers,” but no one ever sat there—not even temps. One day, while printing out spreadsheets, I noticed a lukewarm cup of coffee sitting at that desk. Still steaming. Nobody had been in or out. Curious (and clearly avoiding real work), I sat down in the forbidden cubicle to investigate. Immediately, the monitor flickered on and a spreadsheet opened itself. Cell A1 typed out by itself: “Too many VLOOKUPS. Save yourself.” I laughed, figuring it was some elaborate office prank. But then a cold breeze passed through, and all the staplers in the vicinity clicked in unison. I turned around—no one was there. A sticky note materialized on the screen: “They never gave me my final paycheck.” After that, weird things kept happening. Emails would send themselves. The copier only printed spreadsheets with endless rows of the word “help.” One Friday, a Post-it appeared on my keyboard that just said “TGIF, fleshling.” We all agreed to leave the ghost alone, apart from Brian from HR. He’s researching a way to trap it in a fire extinguisher.
