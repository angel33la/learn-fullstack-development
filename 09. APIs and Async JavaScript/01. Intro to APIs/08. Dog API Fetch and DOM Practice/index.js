/**
Challenge:

1. Fetch a random image from the Dog API again 
(https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)

2. Access the DOM and insert the URL you got from the
API as an image `src` property (probably easiest if 
you create the image completely here in the JS and add 
it as the innerHTML of another element on the DOM)
