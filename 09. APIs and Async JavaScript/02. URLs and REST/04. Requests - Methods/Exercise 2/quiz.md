Try to think of a time you used each of the four main methods
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in the real world as you went about
your regular usage of the internet. E.g. today, I checked the
weather on my phone which probably sent a GET request to retrieve
weather information.

GET: 

POST: 

PUT: 

DELETE:
