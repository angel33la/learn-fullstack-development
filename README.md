# Fullstack Developer Challenge Files

These are the challenge files for the YouTube course: [Become a Fullstack Developer from Scratch â€“ Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzMnsfqjzkA). To get started, download or clone the entire repo and then navigate to the folder you need - the folders are structured just like the course. 

For the full interactive learning experience, check out our [Fullstack Developer Path on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack).

If you have any problems at all, you can reach out to us via our [Support Centre](scrimba.com/help) or join our [Discord server](scrimba.com/discord) and we'll give you a hand. 

Happy learning!
