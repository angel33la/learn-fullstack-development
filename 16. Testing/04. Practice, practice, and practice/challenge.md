# Challenge:
************

Task: Add another component test for the Main component to cover the rest of the UI of the app. 

Description: Check that the Main component shows the labels "Top Text" and "Bottom Text". In addition, it should show two text input fields with the placeholder texts "One does not simply" and "Walk into Mordor" in the document. Finally, check that it shows a button with the text "Get a new meme image ðŸ–¼". Organize all tests in the file in a test suite.

Steps:
1. Add a new test in the file `Main.test.jsx`.
2. Pick a good name that sums up what the test is asserting.
3. Render the component.
4. Add 5 assertions using `expect`. Use the queries `getByText` for querying the labels, `getByPlaceholderText` for querying the text input fields, and `getByRole` for querying the button.
5. What's the accessible role of the button in the DOM? It's `button`. See the list of all available roles here:

6. See Vitest test runner picking up the new test, running it, and passing, all green.
7. Use `describe` to organize all tests in this file in a test suite. What should the name of the test suite be?
