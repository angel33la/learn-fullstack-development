Challenge
=========
Create the categories page.
- URL should be `/3d-models/categories/[categoryName]`. E.g. /3d-models/categories/hobby-diy
- For now, the page can simply display the same `categoryName` that's in
  the URL parameter.

## Notes:
- For now, you'll need to manually navigate to the category pages (since
  we don't have Links or a navbar set up yet)

## Extra credit:
- If you want to jump ahead, you can use the functions in `lib/categories.ts`
  to display the full category name instead of just the slug.
